# Eartquake-Detection-System
It's an IOT based project.This was a group project it is been developed using basic Arduino and sensors. C++ and Java languages were used in implementation of this project.In this the ADXL335 Accelerometer was used to get 3 axis data of vibrations around.A threshold value was set and if the value is crossed it would indicate that there is an earthquake.The working of this based on the code mentioned and for the graphical representation Processing Ide is used.This project provide me an insight of the basic IOT and various implementation.
